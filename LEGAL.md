# Legal Notice

## Disclaimer

This project is an unofficial, community-maintained SDK for building extensions
for [Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.dev). It is **not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by Google LLC or any of its subsidiaries.**

## Nature of the Project

Antigravity SDK provides a **TypeScript library** for VS Code extension
developers who want to build tools that work within Antigravity IDE.

The SDK interacts with Antigravity exclusively through:

- **VS Code Extension API** — the standard, documented `vscode.*` namespace
  that all extensions use
- **Registered commands** — commands exposed by Antigravity through the
  standard `vscode.commands` interface
- **Local state files** — reading (not writing) locally stored settings

## Compliance

- This SDK **does not access** Google's backend servers, gRPC endpoints,
  or authentication systems directly.
- This SDK **does not extract** AI models, training data, weights, or
  proprietary algorithms.
- This SDK **does not bypass** security features, licensing, rate limits,
  or usage restrictions.
- All communication goes through Antigravity's own extension host — the same
  mechanism used by any VS Code extension.

## Interoperability

This SDK is developed to enable interoperability between Antigravity IDE
and third-party extensions, as provided by:

- **EU Software Directive** (Directive 2009/24/EC), Article 6 — permits
  analysis of software for the purpose of achieving interoperability
- **UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988**, Section 50B
- Similar provisions in other jurisdictions

The API interfaces documented in this project were derived through observation
of Antigravity's public extension API surface — the same surface available to
any VS Code extension running inside Antigravity.

## User Responsibility

Users and extension developers are responsible for ensuring their use of
this SDK and any extensions built with it comply with applicable terms of
service and local laws.

## Takedown

If Google or the Antigravity team requests removal of this project, we will
comply promptly. Contact: [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Kanezal/antigravity-sdk/issues).
